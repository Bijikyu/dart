Handel - software for Bayesian inference of evolutionary multiple alignments

Copyright (C) 2000 Ian Holmes <ihh@fruitfly.org> (primary author)

To install: 'cd Handel; make'
Recommended accompaniment: Concerti grossi Op.6 1-4

I have compiled Handel on RedHat Linux 6.0 using gcc version egcs-2.91.66
and GNU make without difficulties. Let me know how it goes for you.
Handel relies heavily on the Standard Template Library so if your compiler
doesn't have that, you may be in trouble.

It is ALWAYS good to hear that people have tried this software. Any
questions you have will eventually make it into a FAQ; so please send
mail to <ihh@fruitfly.org> with bug reports, comments or flames.

Summary of included programs (binaries in Handel/bin):

tkfemit		- generate gapped alignments using the Thorne /
		  Kishino / Felsenstein "links" model, given
		  a tree in PHYLIP format

tkfdistance	- generate "protdist"-style distance matrices
		  for an unaligned FASTA sequence database

tkfalign	- build, score, sample alignments given a tree
		  and a sequence database

There are several other undocumented programs
 (assuming you even call this documentation).
