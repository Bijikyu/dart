matrix exponentiation test
-----------

The matrix exponentiation test was set up to aid in
the development of an irreversible implementation of
xrate, one which does not assume symmetric rate
matrices and transition probabilities.

The test is driven by the script test_exphsm.pl.
This follows the convention of printing "not ok" on
stdout in case of failure and "ok" in case of success.

The test_exphsm.pl script executes a series of tests.
All of these must be passed for "ok" to be printed.
For each test, the results of the reversible
expectation maximization code are compared with
those of the irreversible expectation maximization
code.  For both cases, the associated EM_matrix object
is constructed, and the resulting
joint_substitution_matrix is calculated and written
to a temporary file.  The two files are compared;
if the entries all agree to within the defined
tolerance, the test is passed.

The tests are defined in file test_exphsm.in.
The first line defines the tolerance, the maximum
acceptable difference.  The following lines
describe the tests, one test per line, with
the name of the input xrate file and the time 
to use in exponentiation.  Information about the 
xrate file format is available by invoking
'xrate -hsmhelp'.
