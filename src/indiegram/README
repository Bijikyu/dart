The TKFST model initialization file, tkfst.cc, will not compile on many versions of gcc
with dart's default options.  The problem is with code optimization.
You can get around this by preventing optimization when building the tkfst.o library.
Build it by hand by:
- navigate to the indiegram directory
- execute
    g++ -I.. -O0 -Wall -c -o obj/release/tkfst.o tkfst.cc
- then build indiegram as usual with
    make dep indiegram

- The following make syntax should do this workaround for you:
    make workaround dep indiegram

The model-construction code in the files tkfst.h and tkfst.cc is generated automatically by
the Perl script tripletSCFG.pl.  You can reproduce it by running
   ./tripletSCFG.pl --tkfst --write
This is equivalent to 
   ./tripletSCFG.pl --write ../tt/tkfst.singlet.tt ../tt/tkfst.branch.tt

sample models and information on creating your own models.
