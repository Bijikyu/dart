xrate tests
-----------

The xrate tests are driven by the script testxrate.pl
This follows the standard convention of printing
"not ok" on stdout in case of failure &
"ok" in case of success.

The testxrate.pl script executes a series of xrate tests.
All of these must be passed for "ok" to be printed.

Each test corresponds to a pair of files in this directory,
each sharing the same prefix and having the suffices
".stockholm" and ".xrange"

	e.g. Reversible_acgt_cycler.stockholm
	     Reversible_acgt_cycler.xrange

The ".stockholm" file is used as an input to xrate.
Any line in this file matching the following pattern...

	#=GF CC xrate [....args....]

...is parsed, and the "args" are passed to xrate
as command-line options.

xrate is run on the ".stockholm" file (with the supplied
command-line args, if any) and the output is dumped to a
".xrate" file (in the above case, it would be
"Reversible_acgt_cycler.xrate"). This file is then
compared with the ".xrange" file.

The ".xrange" file can be an exact template, which the
".xrate" file is required to match. Alternatively,
if the fields in the ".xrange" file contain numerical
ranges separated by a colon, such as "0:.2", then
this is interpreted as a range of permissible values
for the corresponding field in the ".xrate" output file.

If the ".stockholm" file includes any line beginning with...

	#=GF CC fail

...then a mismatch between the ".xrate" and ".xrange" files
will not cause the test to fail. This allows new tests to be
developed before the code to satisfy them has been implemented.
(If there is no mismatch, the test will not fail either, but
a warning to remove the "#=GF CC fail" line will be printed.)
