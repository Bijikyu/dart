* allow fold envelopes to optionally be generated on-the-fly. add comment to tutorial about mem usage of fold envelope database.
* investigate general bias towards parameterisation #4, due to high-%ID models scoring highest on random sequence (MD training? local training alignments?)
* query available memory before big allocs
* compare PairSCFG score to explicit (1,2,3)-microsatellite & CDS PairHMMs (base microsatellite model on Trirep_model from empath?)
* allow several categories of stem & loop conservation
* do 256*256 stacked dinucleotide substitution matrix, P(ij->kl|ab->cd) [via reduced parameterisation]
* significance assessment
* webserver
