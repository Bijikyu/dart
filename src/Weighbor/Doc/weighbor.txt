NAME
     weighbor - weighted neighbor joining

SYNOPSIS
     weighbor [-L sequenceLength] [-b alphabetSize] [-i fileName]
     [-o fileName] [-v[v[v]]] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
     Weighbor takes an input file of pairwise distances in Phylip
     format   and   computes   the  phylogentic  tree  that  best
     corresponds to those distances. The output is this  tree  in
     lisp-like format. Currently the input is read from stdin and
     the output is written to stdout. Note, several inputs can be
     sent to weighbor and it will process each in order and print
     the corresponding tree.  Additional information about  about
     how  the  tree  was  build  can  be  output  to  a  log file
     (currently weighbor.out ). The amount of information written
     to the log file can be controlled.

     These options are available:

     -L sequenceLength
          Sets the length of the sequences. Default is 500.  This
          is the effective sequence length equal to the number of
          varying sites. Note if the -L option is not  used  then
          the  program  will  print  a  warning message to stderr
          indicating that it is using this default length.

     -b alphabetSize
          Sets the size of the alphabet of characters (number  of
          bases)  b.  1/b  is  equal to the probablity that there
          will be  a  match  for  infinite  evolution  time.  The
          default value for b is 4.

     -i fileName
          Read input from the filename given. Default is to  read
          from stdin.

     -o fileName
          Write output to the given file. Default is to write  to
          stdout.

     -v   Turns on logging and creates the  logfile  weighbor.out
          The  amount of information can be adjusted by using -v,
          -vv or -vvv to get progressively more detailed informa-
          tion  in the logfile. At level one (-v) the the logfile
          will contain the pair of taxa that was joined  at  each
          iteration  of  the  algorithm along with the taxon that
          was the next best choice. Also printed is  the  p-value
          of this triplet.

     -V   Print out the version number.
