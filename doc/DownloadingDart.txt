---+ Downloading DART

The latest version of *dart* can be downloaded as a tarball or zipfile from http://github.com/ihh/dart/archives/master

Download the tarball (this will be named something like ==ihh-dart-abc0123.tar.gz==), then extract it and (if you are so inclined) rename or symlink the top-level directory from ==ihh-dart-abc0123== to ==dart==.

You can also browse the source code at http://github.com/ihh/dart/tree/master

If you have the [[http://git-scm.com/][git]] source code revision management tool installed, you can =git clone= the repository and stay up-to-date with the latest version, like this:

<blockquote>
=git clone git://github.com/ihh/dart.git=
</blockquote>

This is the preferred way to get dart.

If github is down or unreachable, use the following mirror repository:

<blockquote>
=git clone git://cvs.biowiki.org/usr/local/git/dart.git=
</blockquote>

If you have never heard of git, or are unsure whether you have it installed, try one of the following links:
	* Wikipedia:Git_software
	* http://git-scm.com/ (git home page)
