---++ What is DART?

The DART library includes a number of bioinformatics programs, including: [[StemLoc][stemloc]] for RNA alignment; [[XgramSoftware][xrate]] for phylo-grammars; [[PhyloComposer][phylocomposer]], [[HandAlign][handalign]] and other [[statistical alignment]] programs in the [[Handel package]]; and more.

The programs use statistical algorithms (MCMC, EM, etc.)
to impute multiple alignments, annotations and other unseen evolutionary parameters from sequence data.
All are based on stochastic grammars or state-machine models of sequence mutation and natural selection.

Dart can be [[DownloadingDart][downloaded]] as a directory tree containing source files for the above programs, along with supporting code, tests, scripts and utilities.

---++ What platforms does <nop>DART run on?

DART works for sure on Linux and Mac OS X. It can probably be coaxed to build on anything with [[GNU make]] and [[http://gcc.gnu.org/][gcc]].

MicrosoftWindows? Possibly, e.g. with CygWin. Untested.

AndrewUzilov adds (Dec. 17, 2007): just compiled DART on [[CygWin][cygwin]] (gcc 3.4.4, cygming special, gdc 0.12, using dmd 0.125) on Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition (SP2) on a Dell Inspiron 1000 (w/Intel Celeron) with no problems!  Only tried [[XrateSoftware][xrate]], but it runs as intended.  The bundled Perl (e.g. [[WindowLicker][windowlicker]]) works fine also. 

---++ What do the individual programs do?

The various programs do a lot of different things including PhylogeneticAlignment; RNA structure prediction & [[multiple RNA alignment]]; stochastic grammars; evolutionary  models, phylo-HMMs and [[phylo grammars]]; reconstruction of ancestral sequences; and phylogenomics.

Specific sub-packages address the following tasks...

---+++ Handel: evolutionary alignment & reconstruction with string transducers

The HandelPackage allows MCMC sampling of multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees, evolutionary parameters & reconstructed indel/substitution histories.

---++++ handalign

	* *handalign* ([[HandAlign][link]]) - program for PhylogeneticAlignment
		* samples multiple alignments and phylogenies from the posterior probability distribution implied by the [[Thorne Kishino Felsenstein]] model or (a close approximation to) the [[Long Indel model]]

---++++ phylocomposer

	* *phylocomposer* ([[PhyloComposer][link]]) - tests phylogenetic transducer composition and inference

---+++ XRate: alignment annotation & ancestral reconstruction with phylo-SCFGs

Annotating conserved features; measuring rates; reconstructing substitution histories.

---++++ xrate

	* *xrate* ([[XrateSoftware][link]]) - estimate maximum likelihood substitution rate matrices by EM
		* *xgram*, *xfold* and *xprot* - analyze and annotate multiple alignments, phylogenetically, using evolutionary context-free grammars and EM

---+++ Stemloc: RNA multiple alignment with pair-SCFGs

Secondary structure-aware RNA multiple alignment; reconstruction of indels and changes in structure.

---++++ stemloc

	* *stemloc* ([[StemLoc][link]]) - simultaneously
		1 align RNA sequences,
		1 predict secondary structure and
		1 infer evolutionary history

---+++ EvolDeeds: phylogenetic RNA alignment & reconstruction with tree transducers

---++++ evoldoer

	* *evoldoer* ([[EvolDoer][link]]) - experimental pairwise RNA alignment using the [[TKF structure tree]]

---++++ indiegram

	* *indiegram* ([[IndieGram][link]]) - three-way RNA alignment and reconstruction using [[tree transducers]] and the TKF structure tree

---++++ evolsayer

	* *evolsayer* ([[EvolSayer][link]]) - simulation of RNA multiple alignments using the [[TKF structure tree]]


---+++ Scripts and modules

	* DartPerlScripts: Perl programs in ==dart/perl/==
	* DartPython: AndreasHeger's Python modules

---++ What file formats does <nop>DART understand?

Standard file formats include
	* FastaFormat for sequences
	* NewickFormat for trees
	* StockholmFormat for alignments

Dart-specific file formats include
	* [[XrateFormat][XRate input format]] for [[phylo grammars]]
	* [[PhyloComposer][Phylocomposer input format]] for [[string transducers]]

Dart also has a detailed [[DartLogging][logfile]] system.

---++ How can I download it?

See [[Downloading Dart]] and [[Building Dart]] for information on how to download and install the programs.

---++ Who (else) uses it?

	* [[DART access statistics]] at Sourceforge
	* [[DART paper archive]] (incomplete)

Average: 30 anonymous downloads per month in 2007.

---++ Why doesn't X, Y or Z work?

Check the [[known issues with DART]] page for bug reports, anecdotal usage info, etc.
Browse other pages on this wiki for documentation.
If feeling bold, turn on [[DartLogging][logging]] which may give some insight into your problem.

If none of that helps, mail to [[Ian Holmes]], preferably after checking the [[DART bug reporting]] guidelines.
(And there is an extra incentive to do this: see BoozeForBugs.)

---++ What are the licensing terms?

[[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html][GPL.]]

---++ Why is it called "dart"?

Originally named after a '66 Dodge Dart,
now a [[Wikipedia:Backronym][backronym]] for _DNA, Amino and RNA Tests_.
