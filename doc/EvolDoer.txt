---+ EvolDoer (formerly 'tkfstalign')

EvolDoer is a program for pairwise RNA structural-[[phylo alignment]] operations based on the [[TKF Structure Tree]] model.

It is part of the EvolDeeds package, which itself is distributed as part of the DART package.

EvolDoer's pair grammars can be viewed as TreeTransducers: combinable machines for analysis of RNA structural alignments.
