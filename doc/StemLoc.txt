[[stem loc][stemloc]] is a program for [[multiple alignment of RNA]] using StochasticContextFreeGrammars.

Stemloc uses "alignment envelopes" and "fold envelopes" to simultaneously constrain both the alignment and the secondary structures of the sequences being compared,
rendering the RNA comparison problem tractable on commodity hardware.

---++ Multiple alignment modes

The first step performed by [[StemLoc][stemloc]] is always an "all _vs_ all" pairwise alignment.
This uses a constrained version of Sankoff's algorithm for pair SCFGs.

The next step depends on the mode:

	* <big><b> [[Sequence annealing]], implemented as [[StemLoc AMA]], is the primary mode </b></big>

	* Main.ProgressiveMode is an alternative, single-linkage clustering mode for multiple alignment. Unlike sequence annealing mode, progressive mode tries to give a good consensus alignment _and_ structure, but the resultant alignment is consequently not as good. Progressive mode has the following sub-modes...
		* Main.GlobalMode (aligns entire sequences) _vs_ Main.LocalMode (aligns highest-scoring subsequences)
		* Main.ConservativeMode (does not extend initial pairwise seed) _vs_ Main.LiberalMode (attempts to extend pairwise seed where possible)
