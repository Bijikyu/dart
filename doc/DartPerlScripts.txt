*Author:* AndrewUzilov

Tool for dropping columns above a user-specified gap threshold from a Stockholm alignment.  Also can:

	* only replace the per-column annotation for the gappy columns with a user-specified symbol, but not drop them;
	* drop columns containing user-specified annotation;
	* run in RNA mode - for every gappy column dropped/changed, also drop/change the column to which it is base-paired (works on pseudoknotted secondary structures, as long as they are annotated by the Rfam convention).
