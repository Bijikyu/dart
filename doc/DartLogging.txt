---++ Dart logging

The C++ programs in the DART package include a detailed logfile system that can be used to obtain extra information or diagnose problems.

These logging options are accessible via command-line options which can be listed using the ==--help== option
(they're right at the top of the list of options, so you may have to scroll back to read them).

Coarse-grained control over which log messages are shown can be achieved by specifying a numeric logging level,
e.g. ==-log 6==.
Lower logging-levels are more verbose.
Level 5 is the default, offering an intermediate level of verbose chattiness.
Level 9 prints almost nothing; level 6 prints some messages; level 3 prints lots of stuff;
and level 0 prints way more than you need.

Fine-grained control over logging messages can be achieved using the "log-tag" syntax.
A description of this syntax can be found via the ==-loghelp== option.

Here are all the logging-related options:

| *Option* | *Meaning* |
| ==-loghelp== | print description of log-tag syntax |
| ==-logfile <FILE>== | send log messages to a file, instead of to standard error |
| ==-logcopy <FILE>== | send log messages to a file AND to standard error |
| ==-logtime==| add pseudo-XML timestamps to each log message (NB file-directed logging output is automatically timestamped) |
| ==-nologxml==| use plain-text timestamps, instead of XML |
| ==-log LEVEL== | print log messages down to numeric level LEVEL (e.g. ==-log 3==). Lower log levels are more verbose; 5 is the default, 9 is almost silent. |
| ==-q==, ==--quiet== | Equivalent to ==-log 9==. Turns off most logging, except errors and major warnings. |
| ==-log TAG== | print log messages in pieces of code tagged with string TAG (e.g. ==-log RATE_EM==). Using this form may significantly slow things down, since it pulls in a lot of regexp code |
| ==-logtags== | print a terse list of all valid logging tags (caution: may be out of date...) |
| ==-logtaginfo== | print a detailed index of all logging tags (caution: may be out of date...) |

Logfiles can be examined, filtered and rendered in ANSI terminal color using the fabulous [[DartPerl:dartlog.pl][dartlog.pl]] script,
which can be found in ==dart/perl==.
