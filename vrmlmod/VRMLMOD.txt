NAME
	vrmlmod 

USAGE
            called from within directory:
	./vrml [options] [FILE-input] [FILE-output]

DESCRIPTION
	Vrmlmod writes to FILE-output a vrml file (*.wrl) modeling the phylogenetic tree
            embedded in the input Stockholm format multiple alignment. All branches of the tree
	(including inner nodes) must be named and present in FILE-input, both in the alignment 
            and in the newick representation of the tree. The resulting output file can be viewed using 
            a VRML browser. (note - vrmlmod was developed using Cortona's VRML client ) Alignments 
            longer than 100 basepairs long are scaled down to a default size of 50 and a difference-
            based color scheme is used rather than a basepair-to-color mapping. In a scaled display, 
            glowing elements represent quickly evolving portions of the alignment where in a full display,    
	they represent changed basepairs.

OPTIONS
        -a  --ancestor comparison
		In full display - compare sequences to root rather than parent for glow effect
                In scaled display - compare sequences to parent rather than root for color-mapping and glow effect 

	-b --background
		Toggles a more interesting background (default is black)

	-f --force full display
		Overrides default scaling of alignments longer than 100 basepairs

	-r --rotation
		Disables rotation in evolution animation

	-s --side view
		Sets side-view as final viewpoint

	-t NUM --time scale
		Accelerates the timing of the evolution animation by NUM
		NUM is limited to 0 < NUM <= 10

	-v --viewpoint switch
		Enables switching of the viewpoint during evolution animation

	-x NUM - scale size
		Sets the scaled display element map to NUM elements (default is 50)
		Because of viewpoint limitations, NUM is limited to 10 <= NUM <= 500

	-z NUM - spacing
		Decreases element size and increases branch lengths by NUM to space out large 
		phylogenies. Because of viewpoint limitations, NUM is limited to 0 <= NUM < 5
	
ADDITIONAL NOTES
	- Because of the nature of Cortona's browser and many other browsers, starting positions 
		and viewpoints are variable when refreshing a VRML file. Also, Cortona's MAC browser
		does not support text. (Made it difficult to develop a standard for displaying text)
	
	- The arcs in RNA alignment vrml files represent matching base pairs and the consensus 
		secondary structure of the files.
