INSTALLATION
============

Type the following...

	./configure
	make all

...to make all targets.

Alternatively, the following will make individual packages:

	make xrate
	make handel
	make stemloc
	make evoldoer
	make protpal

Executables go in the following directories:

	dart/bin
	dart/perl

Some programs expect you to set the environment variable DARTDIR
to the root path of the dart distribution, but omitting this
is rarely fatal.

To compile, you'll need the following tools:

  -- GNU gcc  (version 4.0 or higher)
  -- GNU make (probably any recent version, but 3.80 is safe)
  -- GNU ar   (found in the binutils package; version 2.14 is safe)
  -- GNU test/rm/mv/ln       (found in the coreutils package)

You may be able to get away without having GNU ar, but probably not
without GNU make and definitely not without GNU gcc.
